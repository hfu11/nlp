This article reports two intervention studies testing the effects of plurilingual teaching on grammatical development among primary-school students learning English as a foreign language (FL). In a pre– posttest control-group design, more than 200 9–10-year old majority language German and minority language students received plurilingual FL teaching (intervention group) or regular FL-only teaching (control group). Study 1 on the acquisition of wh-questions showed that systematic cross-linguistic comparisons of the FL with the majority language and minority languages facilitate acquisition of object questions. In Study 2 on passives, the intervention and the control groups both demonstrated comparable gains. We suggest that plurilingual teaching has advantages when the majority language differs from the target language (Study 1) yet not when a phenomenon is comparable across languages (Study 2). In neither study did learners show generalization to related grammatical phenomena. Finally, majority language and minority language students did not perform differently, which suggests that plurilingual FL teaching is suitable for all FL learners. These findings demonstrate that plurilingual FL teaching facilitates grammatical development by increasing learners’ awareness of cross-linguistic similarities and differences.

Plurilingual approaches to FL teaching capitalize on such linguistic diversity and advocate integrating previously acquired languages in FL instruction with the aims of developing plurilingual competence that spans learners’ entire linguistic repertoires (e.g., Krumm & Reich, 2013), or facilitating FL learning by virtue of positive transfer, cross-linguistic inferencing, and increased metalinguistic awareness (e.g., Hufeisen & Neuner, 2003; for a review, see Cenoz & Gorter, 2013). To date, plurilingual approaches to FL teaching have predominantly been applied to and assessed for early balanced bilinguals living in diglossic societies, such as Catalonia and Canada (for a review, see Cenoz, 2003), or in further FL learning where learners can build on their experiences in learning the first FL in instructed 2 The Modern Language Journal 0 (2021) settings (for a review, see Fäcke & Meissner, 2019). Across many Western societies, a large number of children grow up speaking a heritage or minority language on top of the societal majority language (Montrul, 2016). Typically, they have varying skills in the minority languages, and in each classroom, a large variety of minority languages are represented. Much less is known about the effects of plurilingual teaching on development in the first FL among such minority language students with a migration background. The present contribution probes effects of plurilingual FL teaching in the context of early FL learning in mixed primary-school classrooms consisting of monolingual majority language speakers as well as bilingual minority language speakers.1 In these contexts, plurilingual FL teaching can act as a potential resource to facilitate FL learning in at least two ways. First, plurilingual FL teaching can address the specific (meta)linguistic resources of minority language students and, thus, partially compensate for the lower FL achievement often reported for this group (e.g., Maluch, Neumann, & Kempert, 2016). Second, plurilingual FL teaching can potentially boost FL development for both majority language and minority language students, since it addresses their resources as “emergent multilinguals” (Turnbull, 2018). Both compensatory and additive effects of plurilingual FL teaching inform curricular guidance to include previously acquired languages in (early) FL instruction in many countries and states (e.g., Niedersächsisches Kultusministerium, 2018). Some initial studies in these mixed classroom settings have reported positive effects of plurilingual FL teaching on vocabulary acquisition (Busse et al., 2020). In order to go beyond item-specific learning of vocabulary, the present study examines effects of plurilingual FL teaching on grammatical development. In addition, the present study focuses on early FL learning in view of findings that effects of minority languages on FL learning decrease as students get older and transition into secondary schooling (Hopp, Vogelbacher et al., 2019; Maluch et al., 2016). We report two studies conducted in a pre– posttest control group design with 9–10-year-old 4th-grade students at regular German primary schools. The intervention group was taught according to the principles of pedagogical translanguaging (PTL; Cenoz & Gorter, 2017, 2020)— a specific implementation of plurilingual FL teaching—while the control group took part in regular English lessons conducted in the target language only. The first study targets wh-questions in English. English wh-questions differ in word order from their counterparts in the majority language, German, yet share characteristics with many languages spoken as minority languages among the students. The second study deals with passives that share many characteristics with the majority language as well as with many minority languages. Comparing wh-questions and passives allows us to investigate whether effects of plurilingual FL teaching, if any, are modulated according to the differences and similarities between the grammars of the languages involved. In each study, we assess effects of PTL on the target structure as well as a syntactically related structure that was not subject to instruction, in order to examine whether learning effects generalize across syntactic constructions. Further, we test whether majority language learners and minority language learners demonstrate differential learning gains to address whether plurilingual FL teaching has compensatory or additive effects in grammatical learning. PLURILINGUAL FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING AND PEDAGOGICAL TRANSLANGUAGING FL teaching typically centers around communicative activities conducted in the target language only so as to best emulate the conditions of immersive naturalistic language acquisition leading to native-like attainment. However, recent proposals have shifted the perspective away from viewing FL learning as aiming to approximate monolingual native speaker proficiency. Based on psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic work illustrating the interconnectedness of linguistic knowledge and resources in bilinguals and multilinguals, Cook (2013) coined the term “multicompetence” to describe the resources of multilingual speakers that encompass competences across languages and render them fundamentally different from monolinguals (see also Grosjean, 1989). In a broader perspective, the notion of ‘translanguaging’ addresses the entire linguistic repertoire of bilingual and multilingual speakers and softens the perception of boundaries between languages in multilingual discursive practices (García & Li Wei, 2014). Against this backdrop, plurilingual approaches to FL teaching formulate methods and practices that include references to other previously learned languages (Candelier & Kervran, 2018; Martinez, 2015). One such approach, PTL (Cenoz & Gorter, 2017, 2020), centers on teacherdesigned instructional strategies that include the Holger Hopp and Dieter Thoma 3 use of more than one language in the classroom in input and output activities, implicit and explicit language comparisons, the use of cognates, or multilingual discursive tasks (see also Cenoz, 2019). Plurilingual teaching approaches derive their evidentiary base from studies on FL achievement that compare previously monolingual and bilingual learners either conducted in laboratory settings or in classroom contexts (for a review, see Hirosh & Degani, 2018). Both lines of research often report advantages of early balanced bilingual learners over monolingual learners (for a review, see Cenoz, 2013). similarly, studies in instructed language acquisition yield advantages for students who previously learned another FL at school over those without previous language learning experiences (e.g., Haenni Hoti et al., 2011; though see Berthele & Udry, 2019). It is less clear whether multilingual advantages can also be observed in instructed FL learning of minority language learners in majority-language contexts. Many studies on early FL learning conducted in European countries do not report any differences between minority language and majority language students in standardized comprehension or writing tests of the FL (e.g., Schoonen et al., 2003; Wilden & Porsch, 2016), and some studies even report significant disadvantages for minority language students as a group already at the primary school level (e.g., Elsner, 2007). However, when individual differences in cognitive skills and social background are controlled for, some selective advantages of minority language learners emerge (e.g., Hesse, Göbel, & Hartig, 2008; Maluch et al., 2015), yet multilingual boosts do not extend across all groups of learners (Göbel & Vieluf, 2017). In a recent study on German 9–10-year-old 3rd- and 4th-grade primary school minority and majority language students, Hopp, Vogelbacher et al. (2019) reported that both cognitive and linguistic skills in the minority language contribute significantly to vocabulary and grammar skills in FL English. When all cognitive and linguistic factors were statistically controlled for, minority language speakers had advantages over majority language speakers in the FL, in particular, if they had a large vocabulary in the minority language (see also Maluch & Kempert, 2017; Fleckenstein, Möller, & Baumert, 2018). These findings suggest that having acquired a minority language may confer selective benefits in FL learning (see also Bonifacci et al., 2017). Part of the reason for the mixed findings for minority language students in immigration contexts may stem from the lack of systematic pedagogical approaches and teaching methods that refer to previously acquired language among FL learners and could thus stimulate their linguistic resources in fostering FL development. As a case in point, Hopp, Vogelbacher, et al. (2019a) reported that beneficial effects of previously acquired languages on FL skills wane from 3rd to 4th grade in primary school (see also Maluch et al., 2016). This may be taken to indicate that traditional (i.e., target-language only) FL teaching does not sufficiently address the linguistic resources of minority language learners in FL learning. Emerging research on the effects of plurilingual teaching in both bilingual and immigration contexts suggests that the inclusion of other languages in FL teaching may lead to learning advantages over FL-only instruction. In French immersion programs in Canada, 7–8-year-old 2nd grade students who were taught about affixation in French and English using both languages outperformed a control group that received instruction only in one language (Lyster, Quiroga, & Ballinger, 2013). For morphological awareness, Basque–Spanish 5th- and 6th-grade bilingual learners of English (ages 10–11) who were taught about derivation and compounding using plurilingual examples across all three languages demonstrated more consistent gains in morphological awareness tasks after a 12-week intervention than a control group who received instruction only in each respective language (Leonet, Cenoz, & Gorter, 2020). For vocabulary learning, a plurilingual intervention study with 11–14- year-old Spanish- and English-speaking students in grades 6–8 in the United States focused on the use of English–Spanish cognates to foster vocabulary and reading comprehension (Arteagoitia & Howard, 2015). Among the students, knowledge of cognate words in Spanish positively correlated with English vocabulary and reading comprehension, which suggests that the students accessed their knowledge of Spanish in FL tasks. For mixed primary-school classrooms comprising majority language and minority language learners, Busse et al. (2020) reported positive effects of plurilingual teaching on vocabulary acquisition in an instructional treatment spanning five 45-minute lessons among 42 German 3rdgrade minority and majority language students aged 8–10 years. Half of the students participated in several activities involving the use of minority language words in the intervention group. The other half of students in the control group received regular English-only teaching. In productive and receptive assessments on the novel vocabulary items at the end of each lesson, the 4 The Modern Language Journal 0 (2021) intervention group consistently outperformed the control group. In this study, the teaching of the intervention and the control group differed along many dimensions—for example, by also including motivating elements to foster positive affect in the intervention group—which leaves open whether the learning advantage of the intervention group is owing to the inclusion of other languages or other elements of the treatment. Further, the study did not consider differences in learning gains between majority language and minority language students, so that the group differences cannot be related to the activation of the linguistic repertoires of the students. In addition, research for minority language students so far is limited to direct effects of interventions involving plurilingual teaching on the acquisition of word-level characteristics or individual vocabulary items. We do not know if the scope of effects extends beyond vocabulary to more abstract, rule-governed aspects of language in grammar. Research on instructed second language (L2) acquisition in adults suggests that reference to first language (L1) grammar can promote L2 or FL grammatical development. In a series of studies, McManus and Marsden (2017, 2019a, 2019b) assessed the effects of explicit metalinguistic information about differences between the L1 and the FL grammar on the acquisition of tense and aspect distinctions in French. In interventions lasting 3–4 weeks for 45 minutes each week, the studies compared groups of university-level FL learners receiving no explicit instruction on aspectual distinctions with groups being instructed on L2 aspectual distinctions only and groups being taught about contrasts in aspectual distinctions in the L1 and the L2. On top of explicit information, the groups practiced the relevant aspectual distinctions in various activities in the L1 and the L2. Across studies, the groups that received additional contrastive information about the realization of form-to-function mappings in the L1 outperformed the other groups in immediate and delayed posttests involving comprehension or oral production. Hence, instructional treatments that increased learners’ awareness of similarities and differences in L1 and L2 form–function mappings led to greater learning gains in instructed FL learning in attenuating negative influence from the L1. Although these studies were not carried out in the context of plurilingual FL teaching, their findings suggest that reference to other languages than the FL may positively affect grammatical development in the FL. Of course, the methods of explicit instruction of L1 and L2 grammatical rules do not easily translate to early FL learning among low-proficiency young learners who have limited metagrammatical knowledge and terminology at their disposal. In sum, emerging research reports positive effects of plurilingual approaches to FL learning; yet it is an open question whether and how plurilingual teaching affects grammatical development in early FL learning, and whether it has differential impacts among minority language and majority language learners in mixed classrooms. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES Against the backdrop of previous research, we carried out two experiments on the effects of PTL in early FL learning at primary school. Previous studies capitalized on cross-linguistic similarities at the word level, such as the use of cognate words and internationalisms (Arteagoitia & Howard, 2015; Busse et al., 2020) or analogous word-formation processes in affixation or compounding (Leonet et al., 2020; Lyster et al., 2013). In contrast, research on instructed L2 acquisition emphasizes the usefulness of explicit instruction about the L1 for cross-linguistic differences (McManus & Marsden, 2019a, 2019b). With a view to effects of PTL on grammatical development, the present study thus includes two experiments, the first focusing on grammatical differences between the FL and the majority language, and the second dealing with a phenomenon for which the FL and the majority language are similar. We pose the following three research questions. RQ1. Does PTL by virtue of the use of contrastive language activities promote the acquisition of foreign-language grammar? We assess effects of PTL in a control-group design in which the instructional treatments of the PTL group and the control group are maximally similar and differ only by virtue of the addition of PTL elements. During the lessons, these PTL elements take up time that is devoted to further practice of the FL in the control group. Hence, we test whether PTL overcompensates for less time on task in FL grammatical development. RQ2: Do effects of PTL extend across different grammatical phenomena? We test the scope of PTL in two different ways. First, we conduct two studies to assess whether Holger Hopp and Dieter Thoma 5 PTL shows differential effects for phenomena that are different or similar between the FL and the majority language—namely, wh-questions and passives. Second, within each study, we probe whether potential effects of PTL on the phenomenon of instruction transfer to syntactically related constructions that were not taught in the instructional treatment. RQ3: Are there differences in the degrees to which PTL affects the grammatical development of majority language and minority language learners? In each study, we compare learning gains of majority language and minority language students. If PTL primarily derives its efficacy from activating the linguistic resources of learners across their entire linguistic repertoire, we expect minority language students to benefit to a larger degree from PTL than majority language students. Since the particular PTL activities include the use of the majority language (German), we can also predict that majority language students will potentially benefit from PTL. The studies test the effects of focused interventions spanning two 45-minute lessons each. Critically, the specific interventions presented here were embedded in a 6-month intervention project on plurilingual early FL teaching, such that students in the PTL intervention group did not perceive the treatments as unusual, novel, or particularly salient. This way, the present experiments can isolate the effects of PTL versus other potential differences implicated in plurilingual FL teaching compared to regular FL instruction. THE STUDIES Participants Overall, the participants comprised 258 4thgrade students at four different German public primary schools in medium-sized cities in the state of Lower Saxony. At each school, two intact classes in 4th grade took part in the study in the academic years 2018–2019 (Cohort 1) and 2019– 2020 (Cohort 2). Each class comprised at least 33% of students who spoke minority languages on top of the majority language. One class at each school was randomly assigned to PTL group, and one class was assigned to the control group. All students had been learning English in two 45- minute lessons per week since Grade 3, that is, for about 1 year and 3 months before the start of data collection.2 Table 1 gives background data about the participants in the two cohorts, split by group as well as by majority language and minority language learners. On top of having German as their dominant language, the minority language students, most of whom were born in Germany, had proficiency in one of the following 15 languages spoken in their families or homes: Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Farsi, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Kurdish, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese. Our sample thus comprised a varied set of minority languages. Several weeks before the intervention, all students completed tasks on cognitive processing and language proficiency. For cognitive processing, we administered a nonverbal IQ test (CFT 20-R; Weiβ, 2006) and assessed working memory using a forward digit span task (adapted from HAWIK-IV; Petermann & Petermann, 2008). For language proficiency in German, students completed a standardized 32-item picture naming task (Cross-Linguistic Lexical Task, CLT; Rinker & Gagarina, 2014), and, for English, they completed a receptive vocabulary task (British Picture and Vocabulary Scale, BPVS3; Dunn, Dunn, & Styles, 2009) and a receptive grammar task (Test for Reception of Grammar, TROG2; Bishop, 2003). As shown by the similar means in Table 1 across all cognitive and linguistic tasks, all groups were comparable. In fact, one-way ANOVAs with the respective test scores as dependent variables and either group or speaker language status as independent variables did not return any significant differences in any comparison for Cohort 1 (all ps > .11), except for lower German proficiency for the minority language students, F(1,121) = 19.027, p < .001. In Cohort 2, the PTL group and the control group did not differ on any variable (ps > .38), yet the majority language speakers were younger than the minority language speakers, F(1,136) = 7.020, p = .009; had higher IQ scores, F(1,136) = 7.510, p = .007; and had higher proficiency in German, F(1,136) = 10.589, p < .001. On all other cognitive and linguistic variables, they possibly were matched (ps > .42). We also assessed proficiency in the minority language using the CLT among the minority language students. The scores for the production task in the minority language showed that all students achieved considerably lower scores in their minority language (M = 11.8; SD = 7.9) than in German (see Table 1), indicating that they were dominant in the majority languages.
